## PostgreSQL 

### Postgres

1. Install postgres via Homebrew
  ```bash
  brew install postgres
  ```

2. Configure postgres to start when the system does.

  ```bash
  mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents

  ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
  ```

3. Now create your first database with:

  ```bash
  createdb
  ```

4. Check that your install worked

    ```bash
    which psql
    ```
    
This should return 

    ```bash
    /usr/local/bin/psql
    ```
